title: Modular Personality Prediction API
description: 
Trait-Smith is a personality prediction API built with FastAPI and a custom-built ML pipeline. It predicts personality types from behavioral inputs using a stacked ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, with Logistic Regression as a meta-learner.

The system includes handcrafted modules for feature engineering, leave-one-out encoding, mutual information selection, and auto-scaling/encoding. All components are implemented from scratch.

The model is deployed as a real-time web service. Hyperparameter tuning is performed via randomized search, and model stacking is handled by StackingClassifier.
