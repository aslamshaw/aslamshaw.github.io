title: Modular Personality Prediction API
description: Trait-Smith is a personality prediction web service built using FastAPI and a custom ML pipeline. It uses behavioral inputs to predict personality types via a stacked ensemble model combining Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, with Logistic Regression as the meta-learner. Feature engineering, encoding, selection, and pipeline automation were implemented from scratch.
