title: Predictive ML Pipeline for Banking Campaigns
description: 
  Bank-Cast is a customer behavior prediction service built using FastAPI and a fully custom machine learning pipeline. It forecasts term deposit subscriptions based on marketing campaign data using a stacked ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, with Logistic Regression as the meta-learner. 
  The pipeline features dynamic imputation, leave-one-out and one-hot encoding, mutual information-based feature selection, and a custom transformer for automated scaling and encoding. SHAP is used for local/global explainability. Hyperparameter tuning is done via RandomizedSearchCV, and real-time predictions are served through FastAPI endpoints.
