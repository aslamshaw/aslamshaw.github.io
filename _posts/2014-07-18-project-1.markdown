title: Modular Personality Prediction API
description:  
Trait-Smith is a personality prediction web service built using FastAPI and a custom ML pipeline. It uses behavioral inputs to predict personality types via a stacked ensemble model combining Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, with Logistic Regression as the meta-learner. Feature engineering, encoding, selection, and pipeline automation were implemented from scratch.

  The pipeline includes dynamic imputation, leave-one-out encoding, mutual information-based feature selection, and a custom auto-scaler/encoder transformer. The deployment is served via FastAPI with real-time predictions. Hyperparameter tuning is performed with `RandomizedSearchCV`, and models are stacked using `StackingClassifier`.
