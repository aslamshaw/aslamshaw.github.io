title: Convolution 1D autoencoder
description: 
  This is one of the project work during my Master's studies at TU Dresden in collaboration with Helmut-Schmidt-UniversitÃ¤t der Bundeswehr Hamburg. It focuses on developing a machine learning-based inverse modeling framework for inferring the internal microstructure of composite materials using ultrasonic amplitude response data. The project solves the inverse problem of estimating internal configuration parameters (e.g., fiber radii, material densities, stiffness) of fiber-reinforced composites from ultrasonic scattering data through a convolutional autoencoder-based neural network.

  The main goal is to improve the accuracy and reliability of internal configuration prediction by applying deep learning to analyze wave scattering data, offering an alternative to traditional analytical models for complex composite materials.
