title: Mechanical Property Inference Pipeline
description: 
  This project is the result of my Masterâ€™s Thesis at TU Dresden, completed in collaboration with CARBOCON GmbH. It focuses on applying machine learning to predict characteristic material values (e.g., the 5th percentile of tensile strength) from material-specific experimental tests. The project emphasizes robust outlier detection and data augmentation using synthetic data generated via CTGANs (Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks).

  The main goal is to improve the accuracy and reliability of material evaluation by addressing challenges like small sample sizes and outliers. By augmenting datasets with synthetic samples, we can build more generalized regression models for better prediction of material properties.
